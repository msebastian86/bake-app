## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Install Github Pages globally: npm i -g angular-cli-ghpages. 
Build project (ng build --prod) and run angular-cli-ghpages - this will deploy /dist catalog to GitHub Pages.
